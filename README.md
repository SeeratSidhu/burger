# Eat Da Burger! 

This is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. For this app, I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

# Heroku Link
The app can be found at - https://pure-journey-69355.herokuapp.com/
Used JAWSDB add-on to connect MySQL database to heroku
